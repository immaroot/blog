title: "Why a blog?!"

Over the last couple of years, I have been religiously following and reading articles of blogs that people have shared on HN (HackerNews) and I have got inspired to start my own. An article doesn't need to be 100% accurate or factual, but the simple fact that people are sharing their opinions and point of view on things are what drive the conversations that are needed.

I have decided to start a blog for several reasons.

I am currently studying software engineering at Concordia University and was applying for internships  without success. I realised that I needed to have a better web presence, for example with Github and Linkedin to have better chances of getting noticed and having a blog would not only help me getting better traction now but in the next few years, since it gives a potential employer an understanding of someone without needing a prolonged interview.

Another reason that has pushed to this is simply that when I have a problem to solve while learning a language or a framework, I sometimes have a long search to find that the solution is not readily available and that just documenting that journee could be of use of others.

This blog was built using GatsbyJS to learn several technology stacks that I have wanted to use or learn for some time, like React, GraphQL and well Javascript (since I did not have much opportunities to use it in the past). The fact that this blog is statically built also provide a different prospective of building web apps than your traditional MVC backend framework, wether being in PHP or Python. This also gave me an opportunity to dig further in to UI which is not my forte. By the way, any input or comments would be greatly appreciated on the github repo by creating a new issue!

Finally, I have followed the tech industry and the tech world for quite some time and feel that I should express my opinions on current affairs. I feel that we should be more vocal about some issues that are ethically questionable and that more people talking about them would paint a better picture.

I will also share some quirky stuff I find interesting..
